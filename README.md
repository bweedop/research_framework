# research_framework
A directory framework for research that involves any sort of text documents, figures, data (within the size limitations of github) and scripts. This purpose of the directory framework is to provide consistency to repositories used for collaborative scientific research.

README.md - Description of the repository, location of different types of files, and any other information that you want in front of anyone visiting the repository.

This directory outline can be customized as you see fit. Some of the folders will most likely not be applicable from study to another so just alter it when needed. The folder that is likely the most suitable for alterations is `data/`.
